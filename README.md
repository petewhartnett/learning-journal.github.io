## Growth Mindset 
![alt text](https://picsum.photos/id/0/200/200)

   A "growth mindset" has become a common term that is used in the workplace, in both large team meetings or casual conversations. Although it sounds good to say, what does it mean? Someone who has a growth mindset believes that they can improve their abilities through hard work, constructive input from others, and good strategies. 
   
Both individuals and organizations who possess a growth mindset embrace challenges and persist through obstacles that they face. Additionally, they improve their abilities by learning from criticism they receive, as well as being inspired by the success of others. One of the great factors of having a growth mindset is that anyone can do it, having talent and intelligence are only a great starting point but not a guarantee of success.
